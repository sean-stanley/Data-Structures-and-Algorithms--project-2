# Max and Min in a Unsorted Array


A linear search is done to find the lowest and highest values.

Time complexity:
The worst case time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the list. This is because each num is checked once.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because the list being searched is not mutated or cloned into a different structure at all. Only static pointers are created.
