# Dutch National Flag Problem

The solution uses three markers to keep track of the last 0 position, the last 2 position and moves the middle marker between them.


Time complexity:
The worst case time complexity is O(n) where n is the size of the input list because only a single iteration is done to sort the list.

Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(1) because the list is sorted in place without any extra intermediary data structures.
